						<a class="anchor" id="intro"></a>
						<hr>
						<p class="text">
							<!--As an electrical engineering Master's student, I enjoy integrating my interest in circuits with my knowledge of software systems and scripting. I've formally studied programming, OS, and systems at UC Berkeley during my undergraduate education but primarily worked with PCBs, circuits, ICs, development boards, etc. in my <a href="research">research</a> and other <a href="projects">club/class projects</a>. I'm always looking to integrate these domains, improving hardware design and efficiency by exploring the EE/CS interface.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							My interest in physics and math in high school quickly grew into a love of application-oriented problem-solving after my first electrical engineering internship at <a href="work#atx">ATX Networks</a>. There, after familiarizing myself with the full suite of hardware test equipment, I primarily worked on optimizing an optical network performance model to enhance the placement of telecom equipment. Once at UC Berkeley as a college student, I realized that I specifically enjoy analyzing, designing, and optimizing circuits. Additionally, though I didn't yet have much of a background in computer science, I quickly gained familiarity with various tools and technologies through my coursework and by learning from my more CS-oriented peers. Most recently, I <a href="work#mumec">worked with a startup, MuMec</a>, to build a next-gen hearing aid device with new features and optimal performance metrics.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							I view the pursuit of knowledge as akin to building the ideal spider web, where new topics I encounter are wispy strands. Building the web in many new directions may seem productive at the start because it covers so much area, but the structure itself won't last long. It's worked far better for me to build a sturdy base as a foundation to springboard new intellectual endeavors off of. I've applied this strategy to my studies in EE, mastering introductory content as an <a href="teaching#16a">EECS 16 series TA</a> even as I take <a href="coursework#categorizedclasses">upper division courses myself</a>. Despite my focus in EE, I've also taken the foundational classes in CS that many software engineers take. This has helped me gain exposure to a different kind of problem-solving (inherent in algorithms and programming), and I can now teach someone else in a way that helps them visualize concepts through my eyes.
