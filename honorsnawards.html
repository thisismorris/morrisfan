						After confirming my admission to the UC Berkeley exchange program, I started applying for the NTHU Pilot Scholarship. This scholarship is 65% provided by National Tsing Hua University’s Global Office and 35% by the Electrical Engineering Dept. I was lucky enough to finally receive scholarships from both parties. I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Chin Liang Wang, my supervisor from NTHUEE for the letter of recommendation.
