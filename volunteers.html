						Recognizing that some students faced financial constraints preventing access to learning English and struggled with English-speaking abilities, I applied for the English Teaching Assistant (TA) role at NTUST Language Center. I designed courses and provided individual office hours for them. This experience not only deepened my understanding of effective teaching methodologies but also gave me the joy of helping classmates overcome their linguistic barriers. Working closely with more than 20 students, at the end of the semester, I witnessed their notable progress and observed the positive influence of providing accessible education. This journey underscored for me the importance of educational equality.

						Based on my English proficiency, I was appointed as the residential assistant (RA) of the international student dormitory at NTUST, a role I embraced with enthusiasm. NTUST hosts the largest population of international students, representing diverse backgrounds from Indonesia, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and 25 other countries. As an RA, I discovered the importance of fostering a global perspective, respecting one's origin, cultural background, and language, and creating a comfortable environment that hinges on mutual respect. I am the first Taiwanese in charge of the international dormitory, I successfully forged connections with students from various countries, laying the inspiration for my immersive exchange year at Berkeley.

						Recognizing the need for a thriving ECE community, I co-founded the ECE student association at NTUST. The association had lost its prominence due to previous mismanagement, leading to limited participation in departmental events, including sports competitions. Passionate about both engineering and fitness, I viewed this as an opportunity to not only revitalize the association but also to demonstrate my leadership capabilities, revitalizing it within a year to become an active part of the department. This effort not only enhanced departmental participation but also showcased my leadership capabilities, demonstrating success in managing a team and overcoming challenges.

I worked pleasantly with Prof. Naoki Hirota, Director of CCC. My job is to introduce the program of community college CCC and DVC to students in Taiwan who seek USA education.
