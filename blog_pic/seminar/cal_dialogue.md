# The Intersection of AI and Biotech

I have the chance to join the Berkeley Dialogue 2023: The Intersection of AI and Biotech as an incoming UC Berkeley student. The campaign was hold in Regent, Taipei. The Intersection of AI and Biotech will feature a panel of experts who will provide insights into the latest trends, challenges, and opportunities in these hottest fields. Hosted by Prof. Matthew Sherburne, Professor of Materials Science Engineering and Director for International Partnerships, Berkeley Engineering. The panelists will include: 

- Prof. Jowy Tani: Professor and CEO, Biomed Accelerator, Taipei Medical University 
- Prof. Yu-Chuan Jack Li:  Professor and Medical AI Expert, Taipei Medical University
- Prof. Jane Tseng: Director Drug Research Center and Professor of Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Informatics, National Taiwan University, Co-Founder VIRTUALMAN
- Prof. Hung-Yi Lee: Associate Professor of the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering of National Taiwan University

This is a unique opportunity for me to engage with some of the brightest minds in the fields of AI and Biotech, to learn about the latest research and developments, and to interact with alumni and GLOBE visiting faculties and students (24 students)! It was a wonderful night.

I love Prof. Hung-Yi Lee a lot, I watched every single videos he posted on YouTube. And I am interested in Machine learning and Artificial inteligence. It's my pleasure to meet Prof. Hung-Yi Lee in person. We even discuss the projets I am working on now.

Prof. Matthew Sherburne is in charge of the GLOBE program NTHU signed with UC Berkeley. This is my second time meet him. I can't wait to start my Cal life in August.

I have met several GLOBE students from Berkeley, Clooege of Engineering. Some of them are in EE, I asked about the clubs and some recommended activites to join at UC Berkeley.

**Matthew Sherburne: Whats makes Taiwan a special place for medical and semiconductor?**

> Jowy Tsai: Taiwan has a well health care health system, AI ICT industry experience advantage. The combination of this two and take the advantages is still difficult and that's what we need to works on now.

> Jack Lee: Taiwan has unique position. In other wrds, Quality(80%) vs cost(20%) is the best. He then mentioned an YouTuber who broke his angle was surprised with the price of drug and cure fee in Taiwan. He compare some other country’s expensive fee. In Taiwan we always have the cost effective. Talked about centralize health care data base, Denmark, it's much easy than Taiwan, Taiwan has 21/450 top medical center. Taiwan is the best place to learn Chinese medicine, the pharmacies are connected together. Unique eco-system. Second, NVdia AI chips, we have hardware and supply, it can’t live without TSMC. 

> Allen: the cost effect to start-up company in Taiwan. If you want to innovate, you need to down the cost. Central data base is about people. People are willing to talk about your innovative ideas. Since Taiwan is small. Within 30mins you can talk to someone you want. Second, Microsoft.invested 6 new companies. 

> Hung-Yi Lee: Prof Hung-Yi Lee use Chat GPT for the reference for the hole dialog since he humbly think he is not the expert in this field. 

**Matthew Sherburne: What are some promising product or applicaitions for AI using in medical?**

> Jowy Tsai: medical application, promising application, drug discovering using AI. Generating AI, Taiwan’s have less time for patient, within AI, doctors can help doctors todo long term patient following. We can also use AI in the Start-up companies to do cost-down. Not only problems for Taiwan. AI assistant for medical, will  enable doctors teaching materials

> Jack Lee: although we see patient short times, but frequently. It’s important to repeat person’s major data, ex. Cellphone, watch, some sensors. It will collect a lot of data. It can predict a lot of things. Personalize big data, fits for machine learning. Collect whats happened in the past and whats going on in the future.

> Allen: mentioned his experience in Stanford, Ai will not be replaced by Ai, but will be replace by other doctors using Ai. Doctors have use Ai to improve diagonalize. 

> Hung-Yi Lee: will chatgpt understand those professional names? Yes! Last year the experts let chat gpt takes the test about medical. The chatgpt has 90% of accuracy. However, People sill be afraid of the 10% that chatgpt might be error since no one will be responsible for that.

**Matthew Sherburne: We visit Quanda today they apply AI. We talked about that Taiwan has the lowest born rate of the world, and the population keeps aging. Can AI solve this problem?**

> Hung-Yi Lee: Ai will take care of him after 30 years, 

> Jack Lee: yes, which aspect and how t start? Let the robot to take accompany. Can see some light at the end of the tunnel, but still can’t found a perfect solution.

> Jowy Tsai: a lot of younger generation dont have the ability to take care their kids. It’s controversial, emotional take care.

**Matthew Sherburne: How can biotec attract people feel the need and future of this field?**

> Allen: technology changes so fast, it might not be enough. Retain tanents, globol economy is the big problems. WFH, it;s not just about your country, it;s global issue

> Hung-Yi Lee: give a better package, make the people(scholar, researcher) staying in Taiwan be the top 10. The student enrolled is Increasing but we dont enough teaching assistant. 1400 students, can't take care each one.
