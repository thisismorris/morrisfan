**Signal Chain Friendliness** refers to how easily your ADC can be driven.

## The Need for Energy-Efficient High-Resolution ADCs
- Classic readout chain
- Direct-digitizing approach

## High-Resolution ADC State of the Art
- Does high resolution imply an energy-efficient system?
- Very close to the theoretical limit?

    - The unintentionally neglected burden (THU)
        - Power-hungry input driver and/or reference buffer

## Rough ADC Driver Power Estimate
- Assume a 2-stage Miller OTA
- State of the Art (SoTA) ADCs consume only 100-200 ÂµW in this frequency range
- The driver itself consumes even higher power

## Research Goal
- Develop a high-resolution, energy-efficient ADC

### Starting Point
#### Thermal Noise
- Sampling capacitance at the front
- \( \alpha \cdot k \cdot T / C_{in} \), we aim for low \( C_{in} \) as \( k \cdot T \) is fixed for bio circuits; the only variable we can change is \( \alpha \)
- Scaling (penalty) factor \( \alpha \) depends on both architecture and circuit implementation, presenting opportunities for innovation at different levels

### Noise Shaping SAR Quick Introduction
- Combines the best aspects of SAR and delta-sigma
- Requires large oversampling ratio; the SAR provides sufficient, met-driven burden
- Active integrator-based loop filter
    - Switched capacitor
    - Aggressive Noise Transfer Function (NTF)
    - \( 2kT/C_{dac} \)
- Fully passive loop filter
    - No explicit gain, no active amplifiers
    - Mild NTF
    - \( 5-10 kT/C_{dac} \)
- Noise penalty closely tied to sampling capacitance
- Trade-off between shaping effectiveness and complexity
- Both approaches require sizing the capacitance to minimize noise

### Low Noise Penalty Architecture
#### Dynamic-Amp Oriented Noise Shaping (NS) SAR
- Dynamic open-loop amplifier based (OLDA)
    - Noise becomes \( 2kT/A \cdot C_{load} \)
    - Decouples LF noise from CDAC
    - Input is small anyway
- 2nd order NS-SAR with NTF optimization
- Single-OLDA 3rd order NS-SAR
    - No need to change the gain, but adding another capacitance to increase the order
- Floating inverter OLDA
    - Completely open-loop operation
    - Self-quenched, gain self-stabilized, no timer needed (risky)
    - CRSV and output and the supply
    - Gain is controllable by capacitance
        - \( G = (\alpha \cdot CRSV \cdot \Delta V_s) / (C_L \cdot V_t) \), \( \Delta V_s = 200mV \)
            - \( \Delta V_s \) depends on the process
        - Power comes from the current passing through the CRSV, with only 200mV across the cap, not too large

### Summary
- OLDA separates loop filter noise from sample cap
- Great energy efficiency
- Effective noise shaping
- We aim for \( \alpha \) close to 2
- Smaller DAC with fewer caps => less power consumption

## Can We Actually Build Low OSR NS-SAR ADCs?
- Need high loop filter order
- Need decent integrator
- Use fourth order to push back the bandwidth

### Breaking the Noise-Capacitance Trade-Off
#### Sampling \( kT/C \) Noise Cancellation Techniques

- \( kT/C \) cancellation by reusing hardware
    - Reuse the OLDA for noise extraction
    - Charge sharing to perform the cancellation, low cost
- \( kT/C \) cancellation steps
    - Reduce the gain of amplifier to lower its own noise, achieving 8~16dB of gain reduction
- Improves both noise and track phase non-linearity
- Harmonic noise also gets attenuated; why?

#### Limitation of \( kT/C \) Cancellation
- Imperfect cancellation
    - In reality...
    - Path gain changes due to DA, \( C_{cap} \) mismatches, and parasitics
    - Limits the reduction of \( C_{DAC} \)
- DA noise overhead
    - An extra \( kT/G_C \) during the noise extraction process
- Timing overhead
    - Slightly elongated

## Low-Cost Built-In Input Buffering
Implement the buffer within the ADC itself

### Concept of Buffer in the Loop (BIL)
- Doubles sampling noise: \( C_{DAC} \) and \( C_s \)
- Place \( C_{DAC} \) in the signal path instead of the feedback bus
    - Enables \( C_{DAC} \) noise cancellation after buffering
<img src="/blog_pic/pics/ADC_20250124_2.jpg" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" >
- Push-pull source follower buffer
    - Increases energy efficiency

Why not consider chopping?

### Amplifier as Buffer in a Two-Stage Pipelined ADC
- They have an interstage gain amp
- Why not use it to buffer the input?
