I had the incredible opportunity to be a volunteer at the Taiwan Tech Summit, an event that's all about connecting professionals from diverse fields and shaping the future of Taiwanese Tech industries. This year's summit dived deep into the world of AI and its transformative impact on technology and various sectors. From AI & Data Science to Hardware, Biotech, AI Security, and Investment Trends, every forum was a treasure trove of insights.

My role was to **provide instant assistance at the information center**, and it was an honor to collaborate with Chih-Hui Wang (Jason) and the TWDS community. I want to express my gratitude to Katie Hsieh for making this event happen and for entrusting me with this fantastic opportunity. The connections I made and the knowledge I gained were truly invaluable.

As a student who currently taking CS61C (Machine Structure). One of the lectures that stood out for me was about the revolutionary changes happening in hardware, particularly the advent of super macros by NVIDIA. This technology is reshaping the landscape, with GPUs making their way to the edge, emphasizing the importance of edge computing. A lecturer from SiFive, an IP company, introduced RISC-V IP components, highlighting the ongoing evolution in the hardware domain.

As the hardware continues to evolve, so does the need to accelerate AI algorithms. The key to this acceleration lies in the best programming product, CUDA. While general-purpose CPUs have their place, AI-specific solutions are becoming increasingly vital, balancing power, performance, and area (PPA) considerations.

During the lecture, a question arose about the rules of software that measure the capacity of the AI space. The answer was clear: software plays a pivotal role, especially when dealing with evolving AI models and the need to optimize memory management.

In conclusion, AI is a remarkable technology, but it's essential to remember that it's not just a product. It's a tool that can solve real-world problems when harnessed effectively. The Taiwan Tech Summit was a remarkable experience that expanded my horizons and allowed me to engage with these cutting-edge ideas. I can't wait for Taiwan Tech Summit 2024
