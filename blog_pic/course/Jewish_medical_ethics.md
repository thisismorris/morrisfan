The practitioner or patient understands the bible, and religion of Jewish tradition. If it is relevant, what requirements and expiations are.


Every person has an equal life, you can sacrifice one to save five.

Give birth to a baby, once the legs Are out, it is a life. Is the child trying to kill his mom’s life? 

Preventing the accidents is your obligation, like building a fence around your house.

2. Doing Good
- Jewish principle: having kindness
3. Do no harm

> It is important how you coming to this, manage the way you treat different patient.

### Past experience:

In the ICU, dealing with a Chinese woman who is going to die. She can't speak English, she doesn't know the diagnosis. Should I find a translator or let her daughter tell her (not telling her the truth)?

> Tradition / culture of her family, **use the daughtor as translator**, she felt this is inappropriate. But the doctor decide to respect the culture.

In ER, sesure, immune compromise, gay, not safe sex. 1990. At that time it was a dead sentence. The doctor at that time was an intern. The patient asked to change doctors, without health insurance, he has the right. 

> Ask the patient if she can give her more time. The doctor felt a sence of selfish but she also want him better.

One woman has AIDS, African, and she and her husband share the same middle. Asked about her code status, when she needed a breath machine. The patient wants every treatment as long as she is alive. 

> The doctor decide to wait, build better relationship (trust) for 7 months. Considered she don't have control with her body whil in prison. no autonomy

Woman stroke, based on the doctor's knowledge, the patient's condition is severe. No code status since he thinks every patient should get every treatment. Should we discuss this further (ask other doctors)? 2 doctors hold different opinions.

The patient is out of her charge, he is leaving the hospital soon. His heart stopped, but since the patient has no code. The hospital didn't give him the shot. The doctor is gonna do what is not written.

> The doctor will give him a shot, if it is easy and can save a life.

39 Vienem woman, done plastic surgery on her belly she is not satisfied with though she is slim. The doctor insisted on finishing the surgery. The air tube is given to her stomach instead of her lungs. This mistake causes the woman to die. Do an EEG to see if she is brain-dead or not. The patient insists on finishing the surgery even with this condition.

> Ended brain dead, the doctor finished the surgury and his license is suspended forever. Since the doctor don't know what to do. 

Brother has Don syndrome, the doctor needs to shoot something to check if he has a heart attack. However, the doctor considers her brother doesn't need to do the check since he has Don syndrome. No need to do further investigation. Bias in making decisions.
