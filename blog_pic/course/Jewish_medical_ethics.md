### Past experience:

In ICU, dealing with Chinese woman who is going to die. She can't speak English, she haven't know the diagnose. Should I find translate or let her daughtor told her (not telling her the truth).

> Tradition / culture of her family, **use the daughtor as translator**, she felt this is inappropriate. But the doctor decide to respect the culture.

In ER, sesure, immune compromize, gay, not safe sex. 1990. At that time it was a dead sentence. The doctor at that time was a intern. The patient asked to change doctor, without health insurance, he have the right. 

> Ask the patient if she can give her more time. The doctor felt a sence of selfish but she also want him better.

One woman have AIDS, african, she and her husband share same niddle. Asked about her code status, when she need breath machine. The patient wants every treatment as long as she is alive. 

> The doctor decide to wait, build better relationship (trust) for 7 months. Considered she don't have control with her body whil in prison. no autonomy

Woman stroke, based on doctor's knowledge, the patient's condition is severe. No code status since he think every patient should get every treatment. Should we discuss further (ask other doctors)? 2 doctors holding different opinions.

Patient out of her charge, he is leaving the hospital soon. His heart stoped, but since the patient have no code. The hospital didn't give him the shot. The doctor is gonna do what not written. 

> The doctor will give him a shot, if it is easy and can save a life.

39 Vienem woman, done plastic surgury on her belly she is not satisfied with though she is slim. The doctor insist to finished the surgury. The air tube is giving to her stomach instead of her lung. This mistake cause the woman dead. Do EEG to see if she is brain dead or not. The patient insist to finish the surgury even this condition.

> Ended brain dead, the doctor finished the surgury and his license is suspended forever. Since the doctor don't know what to do. 

Brother having Don symdrom, the doctor need to shoot something to check if he have heart attach. However, the doctor consider her brother don't need to do the check since he is having Don symdron. No need to do further investigation. Bias in making decision.
