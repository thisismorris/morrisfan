### build virality into your product
- direct:
    - no need to ask - almost necessary to use a product or service
- example:
    - invite your contacts: LinkedIn, Facebook
    - multiplayer games: Quizup, Hqtrivia, Fortnite
    - event management apps: evite, paperless post
    - invite-only: clubhouse, feeling exclusive 

**virality: making customers your advocates**

### build virality into your product
- indirect:
    - asking to share on social media
  - asking to refer friends (especially for free products)
- rewarding indirect virality
    - monetary reward

### virality & community building
1. start well before MVP
2. build loyalty through ownership
    - remember the "it's YOUR startup" principle
    > putting fake ads/ideas to test if user click or interest in - follow the users

### community building
the drivers of community building:
1. alignment with vision: love what you do
2. recognition: recognizing early adopters/Heavy

some community-building methods:
- hackathons

### we all love free: the freemium model
- get users
- make them use your free product
- make them regular free users
- get them to ...

### scaling sales organization
- founders as the only salespeople whose initial product market fit
- product market fit: don't declare victory too early
- you are ready to hire salespeople
    - if you are closing sales yourselves
    - if you don't need to customize your pitch every time
    - if you have a (fairly) predictable sales cycle
    - if you have identified a lot of customers

### sales commission
- sales compensation: salary/retainer + commission
- always reward performance
    - by starting with a low retainer and high commission
- the commission is always on revenue
    - 15%
- higher commission for part-time salespersons
    - especially if the retainer is low
- higher commission for product...
- tiered commission with rewards for exceeding targets
    - depends on percentage

### revenue model 1: water utilization for farmers

    - expected 80% of your revenue from SaaS

### revenue model 4: medical devices startup
