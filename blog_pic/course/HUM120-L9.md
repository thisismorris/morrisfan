## Review

### Valued Round (Seed, Series A, B...)
- Valuation
    - pre-money valuation: 3M
    - post-money valuation: 4M, if you invest 1M
    - investor gets 25% equity in the company

- Liquidation Preference
    - who gets the money out first?
    - how do I cash out?
    - No preferences (Entrepreneur got lucky)
    - Non-participating preference (NPP) (standard)
    - participating preference (PP) (double dipping)
        - 1x, 2x, 3x...
        - not fun

- Example
    > pre = 3M; inv = 1M, post = 4M (inv. owns 25%)

- Financial Docs 
    - term sheet
    - stock purchase agreement
    - investor rights agreement

### SAFE (Pre-seed, Seed)

>- no interest (2% ~ 5%)
>- no muturuty date (2Y)
>- usually no discount on next round
>- will have valuation cap

- convertible debt round 
- discount or cap: both or neither
