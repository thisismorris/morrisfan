## Review

### Valued Round (Seed, Series A, B...)
- Valuation
    - pre-money valuation: 3M
    - post-money valuation: 4M, if you invest 1M
    - investor gets 25% equity in the company

- Liquidation Preference
    - who gets the money out first?
    - how do I cash out?
    - No preferences (Entrepreneur got lucky)
    - Non-participating preference (NPP) (standard)
    - participating preference (PP) (double dipping)
        - 1x, 2x, 3x...
        - not fun

- Example
    > pre = 3M; inv = 1M, post = 4M (inv. owns 25%)

- Financial Docs 
    - term sheet
    - stock purchase agreement
    - investor rights agreement

### SAFE (Pre-seed, Seed)
> Simple Agreement for Future Equity vs. Convertible Note
>- no interest (2% ~ 5%)
>- no muturuty date (2Y)
>- usually no discount on next round
>- will have valuation cap

- convertible debt round 
- discount or cap: both or neither

## Persuading Customers I
### Target market, target user
- TAM
- who are the most likely buyers
- user-centric design + validated learning
    - feasible

        - vision/purpose
        - reward
            - payout: coupons, cash, gift, gift cards
            - discount or considerations as (future) customers
        - recognition: founders/patroon circle

3. what do you want to learn?
    - validate the problem/need

4. how will you learn from them?
    - validated learning: carry out experiments
    - "build" - measure learns, what will you share with them?
