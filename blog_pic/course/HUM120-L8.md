### Why/When should you fundraise
> when you need it and your product is available in good use

Fundraising: Rounds and Investors
- **Best Funders? Paying Customers**

#### What are Investors looking for?
- Have a good company
    - real problem, compelling solution, big market, good team, user validation, customer traction

- view fundraising as evil, get it done as quickly as possible
    - funding is not revenues
    - ignore TechCrunch and VentureBeat headlines

Persuading initial investors
- rule1: conviction breeds conviction 
    - advisor help //keep the momentum
    - the "50 done" principle
    - which fundraising round would you participate in
        - raising 1M with 150k committed so far
        - raising 400k with 200k committed so far
        > people always over estimated

- rule2: 

- rule3: have more than one fundraising option
    - choose 2:
        - crowdsourcing 
        - investors/accelerator
        - bootstrapping
        - friends and family
        - angels/seed funds
        - VC
    - difficult ask + different growth plans
    - ethical persuasion: each growth plan MUST be feasible

- rule4: never give up the bootstrapping mindset even after funding
> you cannot say, I cannot do this because I dont have enough money, I can only do 50% now. But you need to have a plan B, how you can do so far with limited money

#### Persuading investors: pitch, presentation, and plan

1. The pitch
    - over email or in person
    > Q: why would people care about it?
    > R: that's why you need advisor to recommend you
    - text or pics/PDF or Video
    - about 100-200 words

2. business presentation (investor deck)
    - tell a story

3. business memo
    - less than 60-page business plan (word docs)
    - The high-stakes venture capital game

#### for best VC firms:
- 200 pitches a month
- 1-2 investments a month
- 50% write off
- 1 in 20 is a home run

- the benchmark-rbay story
    - 1997: 1 taker
    - 1999: IPO
    - $6M -> 2.5B
    > Do you have 20 shots? 
    > No, you only got 3-4 shots

Before meeting:

at meeting:
- tell the story
- show (don't state) how BIG your venture can be
- show (servers-on-fire) traction
    - true metrics (not vanity)
    - users, paying customers, usage, revenues
    - market market fit
- show you do need money to survive
    - not bagging, you need each other
    - scale operation
- listen and connnect

after meeting:
- followup, even a 1-2 sentence email
- know where you stand
    - yes, no, or wait and see
- if they are still interested
    - you will get called back to email
    - you should get a forcing function
    > VC loves to be second investor

VC: The bigger picture
- the power game
    - at all other times, the ready entrepreneur holds the power
        - invesor love: ready and confident
        - not like: oragant, dishonest
- bigger is not always better

#### investor psychology in 60 seconds:
- chasing the hot deal
- rushing to be the 2nd one in
- obsessed with the hot trend du jour
- FOMO
