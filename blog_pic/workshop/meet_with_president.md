I had the privilege of attending the "Meet with the President of NTHU" campaign held by the National Tsing Hua University Student Association tonight, and it was an incredible experience. As a student, I believe it is important to be involved in school affairs, and this campaign provided an excellent opportunity for me to voice my opinions.

During the campaign, we were divided into several groups to discuss various school affairs. We talked about issues such as the outdated student information system, the broken roads due to construction, the insufficient number of food vending machines and grocery stores in some rural areas of the school, and the consultation services available for students facing academic pressure and mental health problems.

As someone who believes that mental health is the most critical aspect of a student's life, I joined the group that discussed consultation services. President John Kao listened intently to each student's problem and answered every question with great care and attention to detail. I am grateful that our school has an active president who is genuinely interested in hearing students' concerns and solving them to the best of his ability.

Although it may not be possible to solve every problem in a short amount of time, I believe that President W. John KAO is doing his best to address all of the issues at NTHU. I am incredibly fortunate to have been chosen to attend this campaign. This campaign was a valuable brainstorming experience, and I look forward to participating in more events like this in the future.
